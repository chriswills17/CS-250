How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
By creating user stories, we're jumping in to the shoes of users that will be using our product. This is highly valuable, as gathering user stories helps gather features and requirements that will prove useful for users. Agile methodologies are generally very customer centric, so by gathering this information and using it to understand the user's viewpoint helps makes the best product possible.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
One thing I really enjoyed learning about agile development was that following the SDLC doesn't have to be a procedural process. For example, taking the time to test code as it is developed and implementing fixes as soon as they are found is a discipline from agile that I think really can help make solid products. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I think it would be the same as being a team member anywhere. A team member needs to be open and honest, have good communication skills with other members, and is not afraid to reach out for help. Here in software development, this can mean understanding and sharing your strengths and weaknesses, communicating roadblocks as they pop up, and the like.
